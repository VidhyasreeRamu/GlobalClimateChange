# GlobalClimateChange

The talks on global warming has always been a hot topic under discussion by the environmentalists throughout the globe. I personally became aware on global warming during by school days. There are also a group of people who claim that there is no such thing as global warming. I personally wanted to explore more on this and hence I wanted to work on this particular dataset. This dataset gives me an opportunity to apply the concepts taught in this course.I wanted to analyze relation between temperature change and its main causes like CO2 emissions, temperature change and effects of global warming like ocean level increase.

Datafiles used for this analysis

GlobalTemperatures.csv
GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv
GlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv
GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv The raw data comes from the Berkeley Earth data page. The same has been used in Kaggle, which is repackaged for a newer compilation.
C02.csv Global CO2 Emissions from fossil-fuels annually since 1751 was downloaded from http://data.okfn.org/. This Data comes from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) 
Ocean.csv The Global Average Absolute Sea Level Change, 1880-2014 was downloaded from http://data.okfn.org/data/core/sea-level-rise#readme. This data contains cumulative changes in sea level for the worldâ€™s oceans since 1880, based on a combination of long-term tide gauge measurements and recent satellite measurements. 
The StateCodes.csv file was created by me to map the US state names to the state codes in order to plot the location on choropleth
